#+TITLE: Untask 0.5.1

This file describes the changes between version 0.5.0 and version 0.5.1 of Untask.

This is a minor release that contains a small number of bug fixes:

- The =order= property could sometimes break, leading to corrupted state. The
  bug causing this has been fixed, and corrupted save files are automatically
  repaired.
- Some properties (e.g. =blocks= and =parents=) could previously not be
  copied. Copying an item with these properties now works as expected.
- =urgency= property now behaves as expected when updating. (For example,
  previously, running =urgency+$0= on an item would double the urgency of that
  item; now it has no effect.)

Note that the save files generated by this version of Untask will differ from
those generated by the last version, though they should be backward compatible.
